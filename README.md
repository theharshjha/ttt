`‼️
Render spins down the server due to inactivity, so the first request might take upto 50 seconds to responds. After it, the site functions smoothly.`

## Architecture

### Server-Authoritative Design

```
Client → Request Move → Server
                          ↓
                    Validate Move
                          ↓
                    Update Game State
                          ↓
                    Broadcast to Clients
```

**Key Principle**: Clients never modify game state directly. All actions are validated and processed server-side.

### Game Flow

```
Player 1 → Join Lobby ←─────┐
                            │
Player 2 → Join Lobby ───→ Matchmaking
                            │
                            ↓
                      Create Game Room
                            │
                            ↓
                    Start Game (Emit to both)
                            │
                            ↓
                    Turn-based Gameplay
                            │
                            ↓
              Game Ends (Win/Loss/Draw/Timeout)
                            │
                            ↓
                  Update Leaderboard
                            │
                            ↓
                    Cleanup Resources
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Server Authority

**Why?** Prevents cheating and ensures consistent game state across all clients.

- All moves validated server-side
- Timer enforcement on server
- Impossible to manipulate game state from client

### 2. Socket.IO over REST

**Why?** Real-time updates without polling overhead.

- Bidirectional communication
- Automatic reconnection
- Event-driven architecture
- Low latency (~10-50ms)

### 3. File-Based Storage

**Why?** Simple deployment without database dependencies.

- Zero configuration
- Atomic writes with locking
- Easy to migrate to database later
- Perfect for MVP scale

### 4. Queue-Based Locking

**Why?** Prevents race conditions in concurrent game endings.

```javascript
let lockPromise = Promise.resolve();
lockPromise = lockPromise.then(async () => {
  // Critical section: load → modify → save
});
```

### 5. Cleanup Pattern

**Why?** Prevents memory leaks in long-running servers.

- Timer cleanup on game end
- Map cleanup for liveGames
- Socket room cleanup

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd tictactoe-multiplayer

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start server using pm2
npx pm2 start server.js

or
# without pm2
node server.js
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:3000`

### Testing Multiplayer

1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Enter different nicknames in each
4. Click "Start New Match" in both windows
5. Play!

---

## Deployment

### Environment Variables

```bash
PORT=3000              # Server port (default: 3000)
```

## API Reference

### HTTP Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint       | Body                 | Response                                   |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/nickname`    | `{userId, nickname}` | `{ok: true}`                               |
| GET    | `/leaderboard` | -                    | `{userId: {nickname, wins, losses, ties}}` |

### Socket.IO Events

#### Client → Server

| Event        | Payload              | Description              |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `register`   | `{userId, nickname}` | Register user on connect |
| `join_lobby` | -                    | Enter matchmaking queue  |
| `make_move`  | `{position: 0-8}`    | Submit move              |
| `leave_game` | -                    | Resign from match        |

#### Server → Client

| Event         | Payload       | Description              |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| `game_start`  | Game snapshot | Match found, game begins |
| `game_update` | Game snapshot | State update after move  |

---

## Game Rules

- **Turn Timer**: 21 seconds per turn
- **Board**: 3x3 grid (positions 0-8)
- **Win Condition**: 3 in a row (horizontal/vertical/diagonal)
- **Draw Condition**: Board full with no winner
- **Timeout Loss**: Player loses if timer expires
- **Disconnect Loss**: Player loses if they disconnect/leave

---

## Performance & Scalability

### Current Capacity

- **Concurrent Games**: Unlimited (memory-bound)
- **Players Online**: Thousands (CPU-bound)
- **Latency**: <50ms typical
- **Memory**: ~1MB per active game

### Bottlenecks

1. **File I/O**: Leaderboard writes block briefly
2. **Single Process**: No horizontal scaling yet

### Scaling Strategy

1. **Short-term**: Deploy to multi-core instance
2. **Medium-term**: Add Redis for state + leaderboard
3. **Long-term**: Microservices (matchmaking, game, leaderboard)

---

## Security

✅ Input validation (nickname length, move positions)  
✅ Server-side move validation (turn order, occupied cells)  
✅ Rate limiting ready (add express-rate-limit)  
✅ No SQL injection risk (no database)  
✅ XSS protection (text-only inputs)  
⚠️ No authentication (nicknames are not verified)

---

## Testing

### Manual Test Scenarios

```bash
# Test 1: Basic gameplay
✓ Two players can join and complete a game
✓ Winner is correctly determined
✓ Leaderboard updates

# Test 2: Edge cases
✓ Player disconnects during game
✓ Timer expires (opponent wins)
✓ Invalid moves are rejected
✓ Full board results in draw

# Test 3: Concurrent games
✓ Multiple games run simultaneously
✓ No state leakage between games
✓ Leaderboard updates correctly

# Test 4: Reconnection
✓ Page refresh maintains user ID
✓ Socket reconnects automatically
✓ Can rejoin lobby after disconnect
```
